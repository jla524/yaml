Yet another matrix library, written in C with no dependencies.

Currently supports:
- Matrix operations (add, subtract, multiply, dot, etc.)
- Row echelon form
- Reduced row echelon form
- Solving systems of linear equations
- Determinant
- Inverse

## Quickstart Guide

Compile and run unit tests with `make && ./test`
